# DDF Package

This repository contains the DDF package for Mathematica.

The DDF package facilitates the DDF construction of the Feingold-Frenkel
algebra. It calculates DDF states and their commutators and then re-expresses
them as DDF states. Additionally, the package provides several operators that 
act on DDF states.

The functions defined in the DDF package are derived from the papers [1, 2, 3]
and adjusted to the Feingold-Frenkel algebra F.

## Getting Started

To get started clone this repository to your local machine.

```
git clone https://github.com/hmalcha/DDF.git ddf
```

Alternatively, you can download the contents of this repository by clicking on
**Code** and then **Download Zip** in the top right corner.

After cloning the repository open and run the Mathematica notebook
**User_Guide.nb**. It contains a brief introduction to the DDF package and
explains all the functions and symbols that the package provides.

## Usage

The DDF Package consists of a directory containing the main package file 
**ddf.wl**, the user guide, a script **compute-ddf_states.wls** as well as the
sub directory ***src***. The sub directory contains the modules that hold the
actual Mathematica code of the package as well as several subfolders which make
up a database with pre computed expressions that are accessed by the functions
defined in the package. It is best not to modify this structure and simply place
the entire package folder as is somewhere on your file system. 

To load the package into a Mathematica notebook write:

```
Get["path/to/ddf.wl"]
```

## Compute new DDF States

The Wolfram Language Script file **compute_ddf_states.wls** computes new DDF 
states and stores them in the folder **ddf_states**.

Because the file is a *.wls* file it requires *wolframscript* to be installed 
and must be called from the command line via

```
wolframscript -file compute_ddf_states.wls [LEVEL] [WEIGHT]
```

The placeholders [LEVEL] and [WEIGHT] must be replaced by two integers.

The script then computes all DDF states of the given level and weight up to mode
sum 7.

It is advised to comment out the parts of this script that compute the DDF
states with mode sum 4 and higher before running it on your local machine.
At the moment it takes about 60 hours (on a powerful server) to run the entire
script for arbitrary values of LEVEL and WEIGHT.
